    items:
      - question: "Should I cancel ChatGPT for LikeClaw?"
        answer: "Not necessarily. They solve different problems. ChatGPT is excellent for conversation, brainstorming, writing assistance, and quick answers. LikeClaw is for when you need code execution, background automation, persistent workspaces, and multi-model access. Many users will benefit from both. That said, if you are paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and mainly using it for tasks that an agent handles better -- code execution, data processing, automated workflows -- LikeClaw's free tier gives you 50 tasks per month with 100+ models at no cost."
      - question: "Can LikeClaw do what ChatGPT does?"
        answer: "LikeClaw supports the same underlying models, including GPT-4o, so the conversational capabilities are comparable. But LikeClaw's focus is execution, not conversation. You get sandboxed code execution, persistent file storage, background tasks, and a skills marketplace -- things ChatGPT does not offer. For pure chat, ChatGPT has a more polished conversational interface. For getting things done, LikeClaw is purpose-built."
      - question: "What about ChatGPT's Operator feature?"
        answer: "Operator lets ChatGPT perform web-based tasks like booking reservations or filling out forms. It is a step toward agentic behavior, but it is limited to browser automation within OpenAI's controlled environment. LikeClaw agents run arbitrary code in sandboxed containers, access persistent file systems, execute background tasks, and leverage a full skills marketplace. Operator is ChatGPT learning to click buttons. LikeClaw agents write and run the code."
      - question: "How does pricing compare?"
        answer: "ChatGPT Plus is $20 per month for GPT-4o access with rate limits. ChatGPT Pro is $200 per month for higher limits and o1 pro. LikeClaw's free tier gives you 50 tasks per month with access to 100+ models including GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Pro is $15-20 per month for 500 sandbox executions and all models. Power is $40 per month for unlimited everything plus BYOK. You get more models, more capabilities, and lower cost."
      - question: "Can I use GPT-4 through LikeClaw?"
        answer: "Yes. GPT-4o is one of over 100 models available through LikeClaw. On the free tier, you get access to GPT-4o mini and other basic models. On Pro and above, you get GPT-4o, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro, DeepSeek, and more -- all through one interface, one subscription. On the Power plan, bring your own OpenAI API key for zero markup and no rate limits from our side."

## Where ChatGPT wins

Let's start with what ChatGPT does well, because pretending otherwise would be dishonest.

ChatGPT has the largest user base in AI. **92% of Fortune 500 companies** have integrated it into their workflows. It processes billions of messages per month. The conversational experience is polished, the DALL-E integration is seamless, and the browsing capability gives it access to current information.

For brainstorming, writing assistance, creative ideation, and quick question-answering, ChatGPT is genuinely the best tool available. It has earned its position through relentless iteration and a user experience that just works.

OpenAI's investment in safety and alignment research also means ChatGPT is one of the more responsibly deployed consumer AI products. The GPT Store has a review process. Code Interpreter runs in a sandboxed environment. These are real strengths.

We are not here to pretend ChatGPT is bad. It is not.

## Where ChatGPT falls short

The problems start when you need AI that does more than talk.

**Code Interpreter is limited.** It runs Python in a sandbox -- which is good for security -- but that sandbox resets between sessions. No persistent file system. No access to external APIs or services. No background execution. You upload a file, the model processes it, and the environment disappears. For quick data analysis, it works. For ongoing automation, it does not.

**ChatGPT cannot run autonomous workflows.** You type, it responds. Close the window, the work stops. There is no concept of background tasks, scheduled execution, or event-driven automation. Every interaction requires you sitting in front of the chat window.

**The GPT Store is restricted by design.** GPTs can customize prompts and connect to APIs, but they cannot execute arbitrary code, access file systems, or run complex multi-step automations. They are constrained -- intentionally, for safety reasons -- but that constraint limits what they can accomplish.

**One model provider, no BYOK.** ChatGPT gives you access to OpenAI's models only. GPT-4o, o1, and their variants. If Claude handles your coding tasks better, or Gemini integrates better with your Google Workspace, or DeepSeek gives you better value on certain workloads -- you need separate subscriptions to each. The average professional is [overpaying across fragmented AI subscriptions](/blog/stop-paying-four-ai-subscriptions/).

**Operator is early.** ChatGPT's Operator feature for autonomous web tasks launched in early 2025 and remains limited. It handles simple browser-based actions like booking reservations, but it is not general-purpose agent infrastructure. It cannot execute code, manage files, or run in the background.

## What agents do differently

The gap between a chatbot and an agent platform is not incremental. It is categorical.

An agent platform like LikeClaw **executes code in isolated sandboxes**. Every task runs in its own E2B container -- created for the execution, destroyed when it is done. Your files persist in encrypted workspaces between sessions. You can pick up tomorrow where you left off today.

Agents **run background tasks**. Schedule a data pipeline. Monitor a feed. Generate reports on a cadence. The agent works while you sleep. ChatGPT requires you in the loop for every interaction.

Agents **automate multi-step workflows** through a skills marketplace. Not a prompt template with an API call -- actual executable automation packages that chain together, pass data between steps, and handle error cases. Every skill in LikeClaw's marketplace passes mandatory security review before publishing.

And agents are **multi-model by default**. LikeClaw gives you access to over 100 models -- Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek -- through one interface. Use the best model for each task. Bring your own API keys on the Power plan for zero markup and full control.

## The cost angle

ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month. For that, you get GPT-4o with rate limits, Code Interpreter, DALL-E, and browsing. ChatGPT Pro costs $200 per month for higher rate limits and access to o1 pro mode.

LikeClaw's **free tier** gives you 50 tasks per month with access to GPT-4o mini, Claude Haiku, and Gemini Flash. That is more model variety than ChatGPT Plus offers at any price.

LikeClaw **Pro at $15-20 per month** gives you 500 sandbox executions, every model (including GPT-4o, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro, and DeepSeek), 5 workspaces, and priority support. More models, more capabilities, lower price than ChatGPT Plus.

LikeClaw **Power at $40 per month** gives you unlimited everything plus BYOK -- bring your own API keys from any provider with zero markup from us. That is less than a quarter of what ChatGPT Pro costs, with access to every major model instead of just OpenAI's.

If you are currently paying for ChatGPT Plus alongside separate Claude and Gemini subscriptions, you are likely spending $60 or more per month for fragmented access. One LikeClaw subscription [replaces that fragmentation](/blog/stop-paying-four-ai-subscriptions/).

## The honest assessment

ChatGPT is the best conversational AI product available today. If your primary need is a chat interface for brainstorming, writing, and quick answers, it delivers.

But the AI market is moving beyond conversation. The [shift from chatbots to agents](/blog/rise-of-agentic-ai-2026/) is accelerating. It is not a prediction. It is happening.

LikeClaw is built for that shift. Sandboxed execution. Persistent workspaces. Background automation. Multi-model access. A vetted skills marketplace. These are not features you bolt onto a chat interface. They require different architecture.

If you are evaluating [ChatGPT vs OpenClaw vs LikeClaw](/comparisons/likeclaw-vs-openclaw/), the answer depends on what you need. For conversation, ChatGPT. For local-first agents with full system access (and all the risks that entails), OpenClaw. For cloud-native agents that execute securely, predictably, and without three days of setup -- LikeClaw.

Different tools for different jobs. We just think more jobs need agents than chatbots.
