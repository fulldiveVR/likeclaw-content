      - "Cursor is the fastest-growing AI development tool in history. Over $1B in annual recurring revenue. More than 360,000 paying users. A $29.3B valuation built on one insight: developers want AI woven directly into the editor where they write code. That insight was correct, and the execution has been exceptional."
      - "LikeClaw is not trying to be a better Cursor. We are not building an IDE. We are building a general-purpose AI agent platform for everything that happens outside the editor: email automation, data processing, web scraping, document analysis, background task execution, and multi-step workflows that span tools and services."
      - "Cursor makes you a faster coder. LikeClaw handles the work that is not coding at all. For most professionals, that non-coding work consumes the majority of their day."

    items:
      - question: "Should I choose one or both?"
        answer: "Both, if your work extends beyond writing code. Cursor is the best AI code editor available — use it for development. LikeClaw handles the rest: task automation, data processing, email management, background jobs, and multi-tool workflows. They occupy different categories and solve different problems."
      - question: "Can LikeClaw write code like Cursor?"
        answer: "LikeClaw can execute code in sandboxed cloud containers, which is useful for automation scripts, data processing, and background tasks. But it is not an IDE. If you are writing, editing, and debugging application code, Cursor is purpose-built for that workflow. LikeClaw is purpose-built for running code as part of larger automated workflows."
      - question: "How do they compare on pricing?"
        answer: "Different models. Cursor offers a free tier, Pro at $20/month, and Business at $40/month — fixed subscriptions. LikeClaw uses pay-per-task pricing: every task costs between $0.001 and $0.15 depending on the model. You see the cost before every run and set a monthly spending cap. No subscription required. You pay only for what you use."
      - question: "Do they use the same AI models?"
        answer: "There is overlap. Cursor supports multiple models including Claude and GPT-4. LikeClaw provides access to 100+ models from any provider — Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, and open-source options — all through a single account with pay-per-task pricing. One account, every model."

## When to use Cursor

Cursor is the right tool when you are writing, editing, and debugging code inside a project. It understands your codebase, provides intelligent completions, and lets you refactor across files using natural language. If you spend your day in an IDE building software, Cursor is the best AI-assisted environment for that work.

The product earned its position. Reaching $1B in annual recurring revenue in roughly 24 months is not an accident — it reflects a product that developers genuinely rely on. Cursor took the "vibe coding" wave and turned it into a professional-grade tool that works for individual developers and enterprise teams alike.

Use Cursor for writing application code, debugging, refactoring, code review, and any task where you need deep context about a specific codebase. That is what it was built for, and it does it better than anything else available.

## When to use LikeClaw

LikeClaw is the right tool for everything that happens outside the editor. Most professionals — even developers — spend a significant portion of their day on tasks that have nothing to do with writing code: processing data, managing email, generating reports, scraping information from the web, coordinating across tools, and running background automations.

These tasks need an AI agent that can execute code in sandboxed cloud containers, connect to external services, run autonomously in the background, and handle multi-step workflows across different tools. That is what LikeClaw does.

Specific workflows where LikeClaw fits and Cursor does not:

- **Email automation**: Triage, draft responses, route by priority — running 24/7 without your IDE open
- **Data processing**: Clean CSVs, analyze datasets, scrape websites in isolated [E2B sandboxes](/use-cases/code-execution/)
- **Background monitoring**: Watch for events across services and take action automatically
- **Multi-tool orchestration**: Chain tasks across Gmail, Slack, Notion, and Linear in a single workflow
- **Non-coding automation**: Document analysis, report generation, scheduling — tasks that do not involve an IDE at all

LikeClaw runs these in sandboxed cloud containers with transparent pay-per-task pricing ($0.001-0.10 per task), access to 100+ AI models, and a vetted skills marketplace. No local setup required. No security risks to your development machine.

## When to use both

The strongest setup is using both tools for what each does best. Cursor handles your development workflow inside the IDE. LikeClaw handles the automation, data processing, and communication workflows that surround your development work.

A typical day might look like this: Cursor helps you write and ship code. LikeClaw monitors your inbox, processes incoming data, runs scheduled reports, and manages the operational tasks that would otherwise pull you out of deep work.

This is not an either-or decision. Cursor and LikeClaw are complementary tools in the same way that a code editor and a task manager are complementary — different categories solving different problems.
