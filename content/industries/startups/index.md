    items:
      - question: "Can I really start for free?"
        answer: "Yes. The free tier includes 50 tasks per month, basic models (GPT-4o mini, Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash), one persistent workspace, and access to the vetted skills marketplace. No credit card required. No expiration. It is not a trial -- it is a permanent tier designed to be useful on its own. Many solo founders run their entire AI workflow on the free plan."
      - question: "Is it powerful enough for technical work?"
        answer: "Yes. LikeClaw runs sandboxed code execution in E2B containers with persistent file storage. You can execute Python, Node.js, shell scripts, and more. You get access to 100+ models including Claude Opus, GPT-4o, and Gemini Pro on the paid plans. The same infrastructure handles data analysis, code generation, automated testing, and web automation. It is the same power as running AI agents locally, minus the 3-day setup and security exposure."
      - question: "What happens when I need more?"
        answer: "You upgrade. Pro at $15-20/month gives you unlimited chat, 500 sandbox executions, all models, and 5 workspaces. Power at $40/month gives you unlimited everything plus BYOK support with zero markup on API calls. When you hire your first team member, the Team plan at $25/seat adds multi-tenant workspaces, SSO, and centralized billing. No cliff pricing, no enterprise minimums, no sales calls required."
      - question: "Do I need to be technical to use it?"
        answer: "No. LikeClaw runs in your browser. You describe tasks in plain language. The AI agent handles execution in the cloud. There is no terminal, no command line, no config files, and no dependencies to install. If you can write an email describing what you need done, you can use LikeClaw. Technical founders get the full power of sandboxed code execution. Non-technical founders get an AI assistant that actually does things -- not just talks about them."

## The startup resource problem

Every founder knows the math. There is more work than there are people to do it. You are building product, managing operations, answering emails, analyzing data, handling customer support, and preparing investor updates -- often in the same afternoon. The phrase "wearing too many hats" understates it. You are running an entire company with a headcount that would barely staff a department at a larger org.

The instinct is to hire. But hiring costs money you may not have, takes months to execute, and adds management overhead to an already stretched founder. The other instinct is to subscribe to every AI tool that promises to help. The average professional now spends **$133 per month on AI subscriptions** and wastes 42% of it. For a startup burning runway, that waste is not a rounding error. It is a survival question. If you are juggling ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, a Gemini subscription, and a couple of automation tools, you are likely [paying for four AI subscriptions you do not need](/blog/stop-paying-four-ai-subscriptions/).

## AI agents as a fractional team member

This is the shift that matters for startups: AI agents are no longer chat interfaces that summarize text and answer trivia. They execute code, process data, automate multi-step workflows, and run background tasks autonomously. They function less like a search engine and more like a junior team member who never sleeps, never takes PTO, and costs a fraction of a hire.

LikeClaw gives you that team member in 30 seconds. No local setup. No environment configuration. No three-day installation process. You sign up, describe a task, and the agent runs it in a sandboxed cloud container. Need to triage 200 emails by priority? [Set up an automated workflow](/use-cases/email-automation/) and reclaim the two hours a day you are spending in your inbox. Need to pull data from three different tools and generate a weekly report? An agent handles it while you focus on the investor meeting.

The difference between this and hiring a virtual assistant at $2,000-5,000 per month is not just cost. It is speed. A VA takes days to onboard. An AI agent takes seconds to configure. And unlike a VA, the agent works at 3 AM when you are finally asleep.

## The vibe coding generation

Something has changed in how startups build product. Replit reports that **75% of its users are now non-coders** building functional software with AI assistance. Y Combinator's Winter 2025 batch included startups where **25% of the companies had codebases that were 95% AI-generated**. This is not a curiosity. It is a structural shift in how software gets built.

For founders, this means the line between "technical" and "non-technical" is blurring. A non-technical founder with access to the right AI tools can prototype, iterate, and ship faster than a funded team could five years ago. LikeClaw fits into this reality. Describe what you need. The agent writes the code, executes it in a sandbox, and delivers the result. You do not need to read the code. You need to read the output.

## Cost advantage that scales with you

Startup economics demand predictable costs. LikeClaw's pricing was designed for exactly this constraint.

**Free tier:** 50 tasks per month, basic models, one workspace. Enough for a solo founder running lightweight automations. No credit card. No expiration. This is where you start.

**Pro ($15-20/month):** Unlimited chat, 500 sandbox executions, all 100+ models including Claude Opus and GPT-4o, five workspaces. This is where most growing startups land. One subscription replaces three or four separate AI tool subscriptions.

**Power ($40/month):** Unlimited everything. Bring your own API keys with zero markup. Priority execution. Twenty-five workspaces. This is for founders who have hit scale and want full control over their AI infrastructure.

Compare that to the alternative: $50-750 per month in unpredictable API costs from running AI agents locally, or $133 per month spread across AI subscriptions where nearly half the spending is wasted. Predictable pricing is not a nice-to-have for startups. It is a requirement.

## Security matters even at the early stage

Startups handle sensitive data from day one. Customer information, financial projections, investor communications, proprietary code, strategic plans. The assumption that security is a problem for later-stage companies is how breaches happen.

Running AI agents with raw access to your local machine -- the model used by most open-source AI agent frameworks -- means your customer data, your API keys, and your entire filesystem are exposed to whatever the agent decides to do. Researchers found **341 malicious skills** in one popular marketplace, with 36% of analyzed skills containing prompt injection attacks. That is not a theoretical risk. That is a documented one.

LikeClaw runs every task in an isolated E2B sandbox container. The container is created for your execution, handles the work, and is destroyed when it finishes. Your data never touches other users' environments. Credentials are encrypted at rest and injected at runtime. Even at the free tier, you get the same sandboxed security model as enterprise customers.

For a startup, a data breach is not just embarrassing. It is existential. Build on infrastructure that treats security as architecture, not an afterthought.
