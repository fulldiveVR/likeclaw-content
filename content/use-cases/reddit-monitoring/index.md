        answer: "Yes. The web search capability works across Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, forums, and any publicly accessible site. Set up separate schedules for each platform or combine them into one report."
      - question: "How does it know which threads are worth engaging with?"
        answer: "The agent evaluates thread recency, upvote count, comment activity, and relevance to your keywords. High-engagement threads from the past 7 days with direct keyword matches get prioritized."
      - question: "Can it actually post replies for me?"
        answer: "No — and that is by design. The agent finds opportunities and drafts suggested responses. You review and post yourself. Automated posting gets accounts banned and feels inauthentic."
      - question: "What if my niche has low Reddit activity?"
        answer: "Expand your search to adjacent communities and related keywords. The agent can also monitor Hacker News, IndieHackers, and niche forums. Low-activity niches often have higher engagement per thread."
      - question: "How is this different from a Reddit alert tool?"
        answer: "Alert tools send you keyword matches. LikeClaw's agent reads the actual discussion, evaluates engagement potential, summarizes the conversation, and suggests how to contribute. It is the difference between a notification and an assistant."

## Reddit is a goldmine you cannot mine by hand

Your customers are on Reddit right now, describing their problems in their own words. They are asking for recommendations, comparing tools, venting about competitors, and looking for solutions to the exact problem your product solves. Reddit threads are high-intent, keyword-rich, and time-sensitive. A user posting "best VoIP for international calls" in r/expats is closer to a purchase decision than someone clicking a Google ad.

But you cannot monitor Reddit manually and keep your sanity. Five subreddits, three keyword variations, checked twice a week — that is 30 manual searches before you even read a single thread. Factor in the time to scan results, evaluate engagement levels, and decide which threads are worth responding to, and you are looking at 5+ hours per week on Reddit research alone. Most of that time produces nothing. The valuable threads are buried under memes, repeated questions, and posts from three months ago.

**The problem is not that Reddit lacks signals. The problem is that finding the signals requires more time than any growth marketer can justify spending.**

## How a real user monitors Reddit with LikeClaw

A SaaS founder selling a VoIP product set up twice-weekly Reddit monitoring on LikeClaw. Their search query — "calling Russia phone landline whatsapp telegram blocked" — targets users actively looking for their exact solution across r/VoIP, r/expats, and r/AskARussian. The agent runs every Tuesday and Friday, delivering a report of high-engagement threads from the past 7 days.

Each report includes thread titles, direct links, upvote and comment counts, a summary of the discussion, and suggested engagement angles. The founder does not scroll Reddit. They open a structured report, scan the summaries, and decide which threads deserve a response. Two schedules, different days of the week, same search criteria — because relevant threads surface on different days and a Tuesday check catches what a Friday check would miss.

The whole setup took 30 seconds. Define the keywords, pick the subreddits, set the cron schedule. No browser extensions, no API keys, no Python scripts. The agent handles the web search, filters for recency and engagement, and writes the report to a persistent workspace.

## The compound value of consistent monitoring

One report is useful. Twenty reports over ten weeks is a market research database.

When you run the same Reddit monitoring queries on a schedule, you start seeing patterns that individual checks cannot reveal. You notice which pain points come up every week versus which are seasonal. You see how competitor sentiment shifts after a product launch or price change. You track whether a subreddit's discussion volume is growing or declining — a leading indicator for market demand.

Persistent workspaces on LikeClaw mean your reports accumulate over time. Every run adds to the same workspace, so you can look back at eight weeks of Reddit discussions and spot trends that would be invisible in a single check. This is competitive intelligence that compounds, not research that evaporates after you close the browser tab.

If you are already using LikeClaw for [web scraping](/use-cases/web-scraping/), Reddit monitoring is a natural extension of the same capability — scheduled web research, structured output, delivered to your workspace. And if the threads you find inspire content ideas, the same platform handles [data analysis](/use-cases/data-analysis/) on the discussions you have collected.

## Why scheduled beats real-time for Reddit

Real-time Reddit alerts sound better on paper. In practice, they create the same problem you started with: constant interruptions. A notification every time someone mentions your keyword pulls you out of deep work just like checking email 20 times a day does.

Scheduled monitoring respects your attention. A Tuesday and Friday cadence means you batch-process Reddit engagement into two focused sessions per week. You review the report, pick your threads, write your responses, and move on. No notification anxiety. No Reddit rabbit holes. The 5 hours per week you used to spend scrolling becomes 30 minutes of focused, high-ROI engagement.

The schedule also maps to Reddit's natural lifecycle. Most threads peak in engagement within 24-48 hours of posting. A twice-weekly check with a 7-day lookback window catches threads during their engagement window while they are still active enough for your response to be seen. By the time a thread is a week old, the conversation has moved on. The agent filters for this automatically.

## Predictable cost, predictable schedule

Manual Reddit monitoring costs you time with no upper bound. Browser extension tools charge per keyword per month and still only send raw notifications. Custom scraping scripts require maintenance and break when Reddit changes its layout.

LikeClaw's scheduled tasks run on fixed-tier pricing. Free gives you 50 tasks per month to test your monitoring setup. Pro at $15-20/month handles multiple schedules across multiple subreddits. The agent runs in a sandboxed E2B container — no local setup, no browser extensions, no API rate limit headaches. Your Reddit monitoring runs alongside [task automation](/use-cases/task-automation/) and every other workflow, all under the same predictable bill.
