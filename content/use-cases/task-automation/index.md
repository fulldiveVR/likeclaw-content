    items:
      - question: "What kinds of tasks can I automate?"
        answer: "Anything repetitive and rule-based that you currently do on a computer. Invoice processing, data entry, report generation, email follow-ups, meeting prep, competitive research, file organization, spreadsheet cleanup, cross-tool data syncing. If you can describe the task in plain language, the AI agent can likely automate it. Complex tasks that require subjective judgment — like writing a product strategy — are better suited for AI-assisted workflows where you stay in the loop."
      - question: "How reliable are AI automations compared to Zapier or Make?"
        answer: "Zapier and Make are great at simple trigger-action workflows: when X happens, do Y. They fall short when tasks require judgment, context, or multi-step decision-making. AI agents handle exceptions, adapt to variations in input data, and make decisions within guardrails you define. They are not replacing your Zaps — they are handling the tasks your Zaps cannot. And every execution runs in an isolated E2B sandbox, so failures are contained and logged."
      - question: "Can I schedule automations to run on a recurring basis?"
        answer: "Yes. Set any automation to run on a schedule — hourly, daily, weekly, or triggered by an event. Monday morning reports, end-of-day data syncs, weekly competitive research. Scheduled tasks run in isolated sandbox containers in the background. You get a summary when each run completes, and you can review logs anytime."
      - question: "Can my team use shared automations?"
        answer: "On the Team plan ($25/seat/month), you get multi-tenant workspaces with shared automations, centralized billing, and role-based access. One person builds the automation, and the whole team benefits. Individual plans (Free, Pro, Power) are single-user, but you can share automation templates with teammates who have their own accounts."
      - question: "How much does this cost compared to hiring someone?"
        answer: "A virtual assistant costs $1,500-4,000/month depending on skill level and hours. LikeClaw's Pro plan is $15-20/month and handles the repetitive work that would otherwise consume 10-15 hours of human time per week. The free tier gives you 50 tasks per month to try it. And unlike hiring, there is no onboarding, no training, and no coverage gaps when someone takes a day off."

## The automation gap that is costing you 10-15 hours a week

You started a company to build something. Not to process invoices. Not to copy-paste data between Google Sheets and Airtable. Not to spend every Monday morning running the same report you ran last Monday, and the Monday before that, and the Monday before that.

But here you are. As a founder or small-team operator, you are the default assignee for every task that does not have an owner. Expense reports, vendor follow-ups, data entry, CRM cleanup, weekly metrics — the work piles up because there is nobody else to hand it to. Hiring a virtual assistant costs $1,500-4,000/month and comes with its own overhead: onboarding, training, management, and the inevitable coverage gaps.

**The result: 10-15 hours per week spent on tasks that should not require a human at all.** That is one to two full working days, every week, lost to work that adds zero strategic value. Across a year, you are looking at 500-750 hours of your life spent on tasks a machine could handle.

This is the automation gap. And most founders know it exists — they just have not found a tool that closes it without creating more problems than it solves.

## Why traditional automation tools fall short

If you have tried to solve this before, you probably reached for Zapier or Make. They are good tools. For simple trigger-action workflows — when a form is submitted, add a row to a spreadsheet — they work well. Thousands of integrations, visual workflow builders, reasonable pricing.

But the tasks eating your week are not simple triggers. They are messy, multi-step processes that require judgment:

- An invoice arrives in a format you have never seen before. Do you reject it or parse it anyway?
- A spreadsheet has duplicate entries with slightly different spellings. Which one is correct?
- A customer follow-up needs to be personalized based on their last three interactions, not a generic template.
- A competitor changed their pricing page. What actually changed, and does it matter?

Traditional automation tools cannot make these calls. They execute predetermined steps. When something unexpected happens — and something always does — the workflow breaks, and you are back to doing it manually.

## How AI agents close the gap

AI agents are different from automation rules in a fundamental way: they understand context, make decisions, and handle exceptions. You describe the outcome you want in plain language. The agent figures out the steps.

Tell it to process invoices, and it parses different formats, extracts line items, categorizes expenses, flags anything unusual, and exports the result to your accounting tool. Tell it to generate a weekly metrics report, and it pulls data from your sources, runs the calculations, formats the output, and delivers it to your Slack channel every Monday at 8 AM.

When the invoice format changes, the agent adapts. When the data source has missing fields, the agent handles the exception instead of crashing. This is the difference between automation and intelligence.

With LikeClaw, you get this capability without the setup tax. No local installation. No config files. No dependency management. You describe your task, the agent builds a plan, you approve it, and it runs. If you are already using LikeClaw for [email automation](/use-cases/email-automation/), task automation is the natural next step — same platform, same sandbox, same pricing.

## Every automation runs in a sandbox

This is the part that matters most if you are trusting an AI agent with your business data.

Most AI automation tools either run on shared infrastructure with no isolation or require local execution that exposes your entire machine. The local approach is what led to the security warnings from Kaspersky, Cisco, and Snyk about open AI agent frameworks — 341+ malicious skills in open marketplaces, plaintext API keys, and raw system access.

LikeClaw takes a different approach. Every automation runs inside an isolated E2B sandbox container. The container is created for your specific task, executes the work, and gets destroyed when it finishes. Your data never touches another user's environment. Your credentials are encrypted, never stored in plaintext. If something goes wrong, the blast radius is a single container — not your entire system.

This is not a feature you notice day-to-day. It is the feature that lets you sleep at night while your automations run in the background.

## What founders automate first

Based on early beta usage, the highest-impact automations fall into three buckets:

**Data operations.** Cross-tool syncing is the most common starting point. Founders connect Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion, and their CRM, then let AI agents handle the syncing, deduplication, and format conversion that used to eat two to three hours per week. If you work with data across multiple tools, this is where [data analysis automation](/use-cases/data-analysis/) and task automation overlap.

**Reports and analysis.** Weekly metrics dashboards, competitor monitoring, trend analysis — tasks that follow a repeatable pattern but require pulling from multiple sources and applying judgment to the output. The agent learns your format preferences and delivers polished reports on schedule.

**Communication workflows.** Email follow-ups, meeting prep, stakeholder updates. The agent tracks who owes you a response, drafts follow-ups when deadlines pass, and compiles meeting briefs from recent threads and documents. For dedicated email workflows, see [email automation](/use-cases/email-automation/) — it goes deeper on triage, priority routing, and smart drafts.

## Predictable cost, not predictable headaches

A virtual assistant costs $1,500-4,000/month. Open AI agent frameworks come with unpredictable API costs — users report spending $50-750/month with no built-in cost controls, and one documented case hit $3,600 in a single month.

LikeClaw's pricing is fixed and transparent. The free tier gives you 50 tasks per month to test your automations. Pro at $15-20/month handles most founder workflows. Power at $40/month adds unlimited execution and BYOK support. You know the cost before you start, and there are built-in usage limits so you never wake up to a surprise bill.

That is the difference between a tool you adopt and a tool you worry about.
