## Campaign 1: Security

**Targeting:**
- Follower lookalikes: @OpenClawAI, @snaborern (Snyk), @kaspersky, @waboriz
- Keywords: "openclaw security", "ai agent malware", "openclaw malicious", "ai agent risk"
- Interests: cybersecurity, software development, AI/ML

### Ad 1A

341 malicious skills. Plaintext API keys. Raw system access to your machine.

That's OpenClaw's security model.

LikeClaw runs every task in an isolated sandbox. Container created, task runs, container destroyed. Your machine never touched.

30 seconds to try it.

### Ad 1B

"A security nightmare" — Computerworld
"A disaster waiting to happen" — Gary Marcus
"Please stop using OpenClaw" — XDA-Developers

We built what OpenClaw should have been. Sandboxed execution. Vetted skills marketplace. Zero access to your machine.

Same capabilities. None of the risk.

### Ad 1C

OpenClaw stores your API keys in plaintext in ~/.clawdbot.

335 of 341 malicious ClawHub skills installed macOS stealer malware.

There's a better way to run AI agents. LikeClaw: sandboxed containers, encrypted credentials, mandatory skill review. Running in 30 seconds.

### Ad 1D

Every LikeClaw task runs in an isolated E2B container. No filesystem access. No network bleed. Credentials encrypted at rest, injected at runtime. Container destroyed after execution.

Compare that to OpenClaw giving an LLM raw access to your entire machine.

Try it free.

## Campaign 2: Cost

**Targeting:**
- Follower lookalikes: @OpenAI, @AnthropicAI, @cursor_ai, @ChatGPTapp
- Keywords: "ai subscription", "api costs", "chatgpt expensive", "ai subscription cancel", "ai tools cost"
- Interests: SaaS, startups, developer tools

### Ad 2A

ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo
Claude Pro: $20/mo
Gemini: $20/mo
Cursor: $20/mo

That's $80/mo before you run a single AI agent task. 42% of that spend is wasted.

LikeClaw: one account, 100+ models, pay per task. Set a $10 cap and see how far it goes.

### Ad 2B

OpenClaw is free software.

One user documented $3,600/month in API costs. No spending controls. No warnings. Just a bill.

LikeClaw: see the cost before every run. Set a monthly cap — $5, $10, $50. Never go over. Same models, predictable pricing.

### Ad 2C

A typical AI conversation costs $0.002-$0.03 via API.

ChatGPT charges $20/mo for that.

LikeClaw: pay per task from $0.001. Set your own budget. 100+ models. No subscription. Your $10 goes further than their $80.

### Ad 2D

Paying $20/mo to OpenAI + $20 to Anthropic + $20 to Google for models that cost pennies per query via API.

We proxy 100+ models with a small margin. You pick the model, see the cost, approve it. Set a monthly cap and never think about it again.

## Campaign 3: Setup / Speed

**Targeting:**
- Follower lookalikes: @ProductHunt, @indiehackers, @YCombinator
- Keywords: "ai tools easy", "no code ai", "ai agent setup", "ai automation simple", "ai no setup"
- Interests: no-code tools, indie hacking, startups, product management

### Ad 3A

OpenClaw: 3+ days to set up. Docker, dependencies, config files, API keys, permission management.

LikeClaw: open browser, sign up, run your first task. 30 seconds.

Same capabilities. No terminal required.

### Ad 3B

"I spent three days configuring it and lost $50 in tokens before it did anything useful."

That's the OpenClaw experience for most people.

LikeClaw: 30 seconds from signup to your first sandboxed AI agent task. No install. No API keys. No config files.

### Ad 3C

You don't need a DevOps team to use AI agents.

LikeClaw runs in your browser. No Docker. No terminal. No API key management. Describe what you need, pick a model, see the cost, run it.

30 seconds to start. Set a $5 spending cap. See what AI agents can actually do for you.

### Ad 3D

Your time costs more than $0 per hour.

3 days setting up OpenClaw = $1,500+ in lost productivity (at $60/hr).

LikeClaw: 30 seconds to sandboxed code execution, 100+ models, vetted skills marketplace. Your weekend stays yours.

## Campaign 4: Multi-Model

**Targeting:**
- Follower lookalikes: @AnthropicAI, @GoogleAI, @deepseek_ai, @OpenRouterAI
- Keywords: "claude vs gpt", "best ai model", "ai model comparison", "multi model", "which ai model"
- Interests: AI/ML, software engineering, data science

### Ad 4A

Claude for code review. GPT-4 for docs. Gemini for large context. DeepSeek for batch processing.

One account. 100+ models. See the cost before every run. Switch models per task.

Stop paying $20/mo to four providers for things you use 42% of.

### Ad 4B

You shouldn't need four AI subscriptions and three API dashboards to use the best model for each task.

LikeClaw: one account, every major model, pay per task. Set a monthly cap and never go over.

### Ad 4C

Every model at API prices plus a small margin.

Gemini Flash for quick tasks: $0.001. Claude Sonnet for complex work: $0.03. You see the price before you run it.

No subscriptions. No API keys. No surprise bills. Just pick a model and go.

## Campaign 5: Direct Response (broad)

**Targeting:**
- Follower lookalikes: all from C1-C4 combined
- Keywords: "ai agent", "ai automation", "ai tools 2026", "ai assistant"
- Interests: technology, AI/ML, SaaS, startups

### Ad 5A

AI agents that actually do things — without wrecking your machine.

Sandboxed execution. 100+ models. Pay per task from $0.001. Running in 30 seconds.

Free credits to start. No credit card.

### Ad 5B

The AI agent market gives you two options:

1. Powerful but dangerous (OpenClaw: raw system access, $50-750/mo surprise bills)
2. Safe but limited (ChatGPT: can't execute code or run real automations)

LikeClaw: powerful AND safe. Sandboxed. Multi-model. Predictable pricing. 30 seconds to start.

## A/B Testing Plan

### Week 1: Find the winning angle ($15/day)

Run one ad per campaign (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A). Equal budget split. Goal: identify which angle produces the lowest CPA.

**Kill rule:** Pause any ad with CPA > $5 after 72 hours and $15+ spend.
**Promote rule:** Note any ad with CPA < $3 as a winner.

### Week 2: Optimize copy within winning angles ($15/day)

Take the 2 best-performing angles. Run all 4 variants (A/B/C/D) for each. Pause losers after 48 hours.

### Week 3: Scale ($20/day)

Double budget on the top 2-3 performing ads. Test new audience segments (broader interests, lookalike audiences if pixel has enough data).

### Ongoing

- Refresh ad creative every 2 weeks to prevent fatigue
- Rotate new hooks based on what is working
- Build retargeting audience from site visitors who did not convert
