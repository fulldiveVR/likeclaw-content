section_subheading: "Pick any model from 100+ options. Cheap models for quick tasks. Smart models for complex ones. You see the cost before every run — no surprises, ever. The opposite of OpenClaw's cost roulette."
section_footer: "Compare that to OpenClaw: users report $50-750/month in surprise API costs. One power user documented $3,600 in a single month. With LikeClaw, you see the cost before you run — and you never pay more than you choose."
